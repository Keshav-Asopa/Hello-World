Hi Everyone! I am Keshav. man

Check out my github profile.

A year ago I too was completely new to github and felt if someone could help me so I created the Novice Paradigm to help people get started with open source :octocat: and exploring this virtual world.

If you have any query, suggestion or an idea that you think can help this organisation, then feel free to reach me! You can contact me on twitter.

If you think I inspire you in any way then you can also follow me on twitter, github and/or medium.

Have a Good Day! sun_with_face
